# What's new
Below is summarized list of important changes since December 2023 by date.

### December 2023
* Added this changelog.
* Added [Matlab API](https://cosys-lab.github.io/matlab) implementation.
* Added [Passive Echo Beacons](https://cosys-lab.github.io/echo) to simulate passive echo-based sources (ex. ultrasound sources) that can be captured by echo sensors.
* Added the player pawn vehicle to the [Instance Segmentation](https://cosys-lab.github.io/instance_segmentation) initial run so it gets a color ID and is the LUT.
* Updated [Echo sensor type](docs/echo.md) to support groundtruth label retrieval and custom FOV limits.
* Updated HySLAM environment with better lightning and more random racks. Requires update of assets pack.
* Updated Car and SkidVehicle spawning/resetting to disable the toggling of physics to fix issues with custom vehicles.
* Fixed bug in GPULidar not allowing for 2D mode (1 channel). Updated [documentation](https://cosys-lab.github.io/gpulidar) for 2D mode as well. 
* Fixed issues with ROS Client and object pose retrieval.

# General Cosys-Lab Modifications before December 2023

* Updated the camera, Echo and (GPU)LiDAR sensors to be uncoupled from the vehicle and be placed as external world sensors.
* Added more camera sensor distortion features such as chromatic aberration, motion blur and lens distortion. 
* Updated Python [ROS implementation](https://cosys-lab.github.io/ros/) with completely new implementation and feature set. C++ version is deprecated.
* Added [Matlab API](https://cosys-lab.github.io/matlab) implementation.
* Added [Echo sensor type](https://cosys-lab.github.io/echo/) for simulation of sensors like sonar and radar.
* Added [Instance Segmentation](https://cosys-lab.github.io/instance_segmentation/). 
* Added experimental and undocumented WiFi and UWB sensor types.
* Added [GPU LIDAR sensor type](https://cosys-lab.github.io/gpulidar/): Uses GPU acceleration to simulate a LiDAR sensor. Can support much higher point density then normal LiDAR and behaves more authentic and has realistic intensity generation.
* Updated [ComputerVision mode](https://cosys-lab.github.io/image_apis/#computer-vision-mode-1): Now has full API and Simulation just like other vehicle types. It mostly means it can now have sensors attached (outside of IMU). Improved handling and camera operation.
* Updated [LIDAR sensor type](https://cosys-lab.github.io/lidar/): Fixed not tracing correctly, added ground truth (point labels) generation, added range-noise generation. Improved API pointcloud delivery to be full scan instead of being frame-rate dependent and partial.
* Added option to hot-reload plugin through Unreal Editor (faster development).
* Added [skid steering SimMode and vehicle type](https://cosys-lab.github.io/skid_steer_vehicle/) based on NVIDIA tank PhysX vehicle model. ClearPath Husky and Pioneer P3DX implemented as vehicle types using this new vehicle model. 
* Added BoxCar vehicle model to the Car SimMode to have a smaller vehicle to use in indoor spaces.
* Updated standard camera render resolution target to 960x540. Updated standard uncompressed image format to RGB instead of BGR (this breaks OpenCV support but fixes ROS images). 
* Added option to Cameras, EchoSensor and GPULiDAR to ignore certain objects with the _MarkedIgnore_ Unreal tag and enabling the "IgnoreMarked" setting in [the settings file](https://cosys-lab.github.io/settings/).
* Updated Unreal to 4.24 (custom fork needed for instance segmentation: [https://github.com/WouterJansen/UnrealEngine](https://github.com/WouterJansen/UnrealEngine))
* Dropped support for Unity Environments.
