# This example shows how to use the External Physics Engine
# It allows you to control the drone through setVehiclePose and obtain collision information.
# It is especially useful for injecting your own flight dynamics model to the AirSim drone.

# Use Blocks environment to see the drone colliding and seeing the collision information 
# in the command prompt.

# Add this line to your settings.json before running AirSim:
# "PhysicsEngineName":"ExternalPhysicsEngine"
