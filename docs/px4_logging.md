# PX4/MavLink Logging

Thanks to [Chris Lovett](https://github.com/clovett) for developing various tools for PX4/MavLink logging mentioned on this page!

## Logging MavLink Messages

The following command will connect MavLinkTest app to the Simulator and enable logging
of all mavlink commands to and from the PX4.
````
MavLinkTest -server:127.0.0.1:14550 -logdir:d:\temp
````

Sometimes you will also want to log the "output" from the Simulator that is being sent to the PX4.
Specifically this will capture the "hilgps" and "hilsensor" messages that are generated by the 
Simulator.  To do that run this as well:
````
MavLinkTest -server:127.0.0.1:14389 -logdir:d:\temp\output
````

You will then see log files organized by date in d:\temp\logs, specifically *input.mavlink and *output.mavlink files.

## MavLink LogViewer
For MavLink enabled drones, you can also use our [Log Viewer](log_viewer.md) to visualize the streams of data.

## PX4 Log in SITL Mode

In SITL mode, please a log file is produced when drone is armed. The SITL terminal will contain the path to the log file, it should look something like this 
```
INFO  [logger] Opened log file: rootfs/fs/microsd/log/2017-03-27/20_02_49.ulg
```

## PX4 Log in SITL Mode

If you are using Pixhawk hardware in HIL mode, then set parameter `SYS_LOGGER=1`
using QGroundControl. PX4 will write log file on device which you can download at later date using QGroundControl.
