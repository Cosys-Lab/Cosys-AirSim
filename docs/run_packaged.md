# Download and run Packaged Binary

If you wish to test the Cosys-AirSim plugin a simple environment without having to install Unreal Engine, you can download the prepackaged binary for the Blocks test environment from the [releases page](https://github.com/Cosys-Lab/Cosys-AirSim/releases) and run it as a binary executable on Windows (_Blocks.exe_) or start it with a shell script (_./Blocks.sh_) on Linux systems.
They support multiple launch arguments. More info can be found [here](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/command-line-arguments-in-unreal-engine?application_version=5.4).

The releases page also comes with additional downloads and links to the several API implementations for ROS(2) and the Python and Matlab API clients for that specific version of the Cosys-AirSim plugin.
