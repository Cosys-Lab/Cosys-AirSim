# Log Viewer

The LogViewer is a Windows WPF app that presents the MavLink streams that it is getting from the
Unreal Simulator.  You can use this to monitor what is happening on the drone while it is flying.
For example, the picture below shows  a real time graph of the x, y an z gyro sensor information
being generated by the simulator.

### Usage

You can open a log file, it supports .mavlink and PX4 *.ulg files, then you will see the contents of
the log in a tree view on the left, whatever metrics you select will be added to the right the right
side.  You can close each individual chart with the little close box in the top right of each chart
and you can group charts so they share the same vertical axis using the group charts button on the
top toolbar.

There is also a map option which will plot the GPS path the drone took.  You can also load multiple
log files so you can compare the data from each.

### Realtime

You can also get a realtime view if you connect the LogViewer `before` you run the simulation.

For this to work you need to configure the `settings.json` with the following settings:
```
{
    "SettingsVersion": 1.2,
    "SimMode": "Multirotor",
    "Vehicles": {
        "PX4": {
            ...,
            "LogViewerHostIp": "127.0.0.1",
            "LogViewerPort": 14388,
        }
    }
}
```

Note: do not use the "Logs" setting when you want realtime LogViewer logging.  Logging to
a file using "Logs" is mutually exclusive with LogViewer logging.

Simply press the blue connector button on the top right corner of the window, select the Socket
`tab`, enter the port number `14388`, and your `localhost` network.  If you are using WSL 2 on
Windows then select `vEthernet (WSL)`.

If you do choose `vEthernet (WSL)` then make sure you also set `LocalHostIp` and
`LogViewerHostIp` to the matching WSL ethernet address, something like `172.31.64.1`.

Then press the record button (triangle on the right hand side of the toolbar). Now start the
simulator, and the data will start streaming into LogViewer.

The drone view in Log Viewer shows the actual estimated position coming from the PX4, so that is a
great way to check whether the PX4 is in sync with the simulator.  Sometimes you can see some drift
here as the attitude estimation catches up with reality, this can become more visible after a bad
crash.

### Installation

If you can't build the LogViewer.sln, there is also a [click once
installer](https://lovettsoftwarestorage.blob.core.windows.net/downloads/Px4LogViewer/Px4LogViewer.application).


### Configuration

The magic port number 14388 can be configured in the simulator by editing the [settings.json
file](settings.md).  If you change the port number in LogViewer connection dialog then be sure
to make the matching changes in your `settings.json` file.

### Debugging

See [PX4 Logging](px4_logging.md) for more information on how to use the LogViewer to debug situations you are setting.
