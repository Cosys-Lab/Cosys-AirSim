# What's new

Below is summarized list of important changes. This does not include minor/less important changes or bug fixes or documentation update. This list updated every few months. For complete detailed changes, please review [commit history](https://cosysgit.uantwerpen.be/sensorsimulation/airsim/-/commits/master).

## CoSys-Lab Modifications
* Updated the camera, Echo and (GPU)LiDAR sensors to be uncoupled from the vehicle and be placed as external world sensors.
* Added more camera sensor distortion features such as chromatic aberration, motion blur and lens distortion. 
* Updated Python [ROS implementation](docs/ros.md) with completely new implementation and feature set. C++ version is not supported.
* Added [Echo sensor type](docs/echo.md) for simulation of sensors like sonar and radar.
* Added [Instance Segmentation](docs/instance_segmentation.md). 
* Added [GPU LIDAR sensor type](docs/gpulidar.md): Uses GPU acceleration to simulate a LiDAR sensor. Can support much higher point density then normal LiDAR and behaves more authentic and has realistic intensity generation.
* Updated [ComputerVision mode](docs/image_apis.md#computer-vision-mode-1): Now has full API and Simulation just like other vehicle types. It mostly means it can now have sensors attached (outside of IMU). Improved handling and camera operation.
* Updated [LIDAR sensor type](docs/lidar.md): Fixed not tracing correctly, added ground truth (point labels) generation, added range-noise generation. Improved API pointcloud delivery to be full scan instead of being frame-rate dependent and partial.
* Added option to hot-reload plugin through Unreal Editor (faster development).
* Added [skid steering SimMode and vehicle type](docs/skid_steer_vehicle.md) based on NVIDIA tank PhysX vehicle model. ClearPath Husky and Pioneer P3DX implemented as vehicle types using this new vehicle model. 
* Added BoxCar vehicle model to the Car SimMode to have a smaller vehicle to use in indoor spaces.
* Updated standard camera render resolution target to 960x540. Updated standard uncompressed image format to RGB instead of BGR (this breaks OpenCV support but fixes ROS images). 
* Added option to Cameras, EchoSensor and GPULiDAR to ignore certain objects with the _MarkedIgnore_ Unreal tag and enabling the "IgnoreMarked" setting in [the settings file](docs/settings.md).
* Updated Unreal to 4.24 (custom fork: [https://github.com/Cosys-Lab/UnrealEngine](https://github.com/Cosys-Lab/UnrealEngine))
* Dropped support for Unity Environments.
